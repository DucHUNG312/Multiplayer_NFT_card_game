# Multiplayer NFT card game
The contract of this project is deployed on Fuji, an Avalanche's test network. You can also deploy it on Goerli.
But I recommend you to stick with Avalanche network, it is designed cheaper to use than Ethereum, processing more transactions per second at a lower cost and will make our game much faster.

Try to run following tasks:
1. After deploying, move "/artifacts/contracts/AVAXGods.json" file to the "/contract" folder in client.
2. Create a ".env" file in client and copy your contract address to "VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS" 
3. Install all the dependencies and run "yarn run dev".
